TryHackMe - Room - Offensive Security Intro

  

Objective  

Hack my first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job. 

  

Activities   

In this room, I used a virtual machine to access a fake bank. 

I found a hidden web page through the terminal using the gobuster command (a command-line security application). 

Through this page, I was granted access to the bank-to-bank transfer page. 

When I was able to successfully perform the transfer from one bank to another, I completed the activity successfully.
